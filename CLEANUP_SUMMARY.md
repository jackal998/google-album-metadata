# Cleanup Summary

## Completed Tasks

1. **Fixed RSpec Tests**
   - Corrected test setup in `process_workflow_spec.rb`
   - All 22 RSpec tests now pass successfully

2. **Moved Legacy Files to `local_data`**
   - Moved legacy Minitest files:
     - `tests/test_file_processor.rb` → `local_data/tests/test_file_processor.rb`
     - `tests/test_error_handler.rb` → `local_data/tests/test_error_handler.rb`
   - Moved legacy bin files:
     - `bin/galbumtool` → `local_data/bin/galbumtool`
     - `bin/run_tests` → `local_data/bin/run_tests`

## Current Status

1. **Active Directories**
   - `lib/`: Contains the main code for the project
   - `bin/`: Contains active executables (`g_album_tool` and `g_album_tool.bat`)
   - `spec/`: Contains all RSpec tests
   - `tests/fixtures/`: Contains fixtures used by RSpec tests

2. **Legacy Directories**
   - `local_data/`: Contains all legacy files that are no longer actively used
   - `archive/`: Empty directory that can be removed or used for future archiving

## Next Steps

1. **Potential Improvements**
   - Move `tests/fixtures` to `spec/fixtures` for better organization
   - Update all references to the fixtures path in spec files
   - Create comprehensive documentation on how to use the updated codebase

2. **Documentation**
   - Update README.md with RSpec testing instructions
   - Document the transition from Minitest to RSpec

3. **Future Development**
   - Consider adding more RSpec tests to increase code coverage
   - Implement any remaining features mentioned in `spec.md`
   - Address any remaining error handling strategies outlined in `error_summary.md`

## Conclusion

The codebase has been successfully cleaned up with legacy files moved to `local_data` and all RSpec tests passing. The project is now in a good state for continued development and maintenance.
